## Setup for local development

To allow for a reproducible dev-environment, we use `Nix` and `direnv`!

Nix can be easily installed using the [Determinate Systems Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).
Installation & integration instructions for `direnv` can be found [here](https://direnv.net/).

**When using Nix flakes with direnv integration**, skip right ahead to step 6 in the installation instructions below. The database can be started by running `devenv up`.

**To develop locally without using Nix**, follow the instructions below:

1. Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Install [Rancher](https://rancherdesktop.io/) (or Docker if you prefer/you have a license) and make sure it is running.
3. Spin up a postgres database with the following command. You need to choose your own password and username:

```bash
docker run --name tech-survey -e "POSTGRES_USER=dummyusr" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dummypw" -e "POSTGRES_DB=tech-survey" -d -p 5432:5432 docker.io/postgres
```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the `DATABASE_URL` variable with the username and password you chose in the previous step. The default value is:
   `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://dummyusr:dummypw@localhost/tech-survey`
5. Create a secret for AUTH_SECRET by running the following command. Use WSL for this command if you are on Windows.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

6. Ask a co-worker for the Azure credentials or the rights to create an app registration yourself.

    1. AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET: A secret credential created in an app registration.
    2. AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID: The client ID of the app registration.
    3. AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER: The tenant ID of the Azure AD.
    4. AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ADMIN_GROUP: The group ID of the Azure AD group that has admin rights in the app registration.

7. Install NPM dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

6. Run the following commands to setup your db locally.

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
```

7. **(Optional)**: You can seed the database with some initial data by running the following command. For this you need a file called `survey.csv` in the folder `./import`. Ask a co-worker for this file.

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

Note that if you run this command again, your database will be populated with duplicate data.

8. Now you should be ready to go! ðŸŽ‰ You can check your local database by opening the studio of Prisma. If you followed step 7, you should see that the database has been populated with questions, roles, etc.

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

## Running the application

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests

Tests are done using `Testcontainers` & `Playwright`. To run the tests locally, you must have `docker` installed.

Use the following command to run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Code style

In this project, the code style is enforced by ESLint and Prettier. You can run the following command to check if your code is compliant with the code style:

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you want to automatically fix the code style issues, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

## Database changes

If you make changes to the database schema, you need to generate a new migration. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <name-of-your-migration>
```

For more information, look at the Prisma [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).
