3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <prefix>/<branch-name>`.
   1. The prefix is either feature or bugfix.
   2. The branch name is the issue number followed by a short description. E.g. `feature/42-implement-search`.
4. Make your changes.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m '<commit-message>'`.
6. Push to the original branch: `git push origin <project-name>/<location>`.
